# mplayer - yet another music player
This is (yet) another project inspired by tapio's incredible (live-server)[https://github.com/tapio/live-server]. I've recently found myself listening to music, but hating all of the "good" options for a music player on Linux, which drove me to this project. My aim with this project is to make it as natural as `live-server` whilst developing.

## Usage
	cd /path/to/music
	mplayer

A browser window is automatically opened with the player. 

## Shortcuts:
	Space: Pause
	Left: Backward a track
	Right: Forward a track
	r: Randomize

Hope you'll enjoy (cause I'm gonna)
